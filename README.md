# React App for open coding of qualitative Data

This app is a prototype that was Part of my bachelor thesis. The goal was to create an interactive App to analyse qualitative Data with open coding. 

## Running the App
The app was written with NodeJS Version 5.14.0, but it may also work with newer Version.

In the project directory, run `npm install`, to install all the needed packages. Afterwards you can run the app with `npm start` in development mode. You can access it in the browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To create a optimized build run `npm run build`. The app will be build to the `build` folder.
